# ðŸ§¾ Vendor Sales Summary Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **Vendor Sales Summary Project** automates the entire process of extracting, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing vendor sales data.  
It creates a seamless **ETL (Extractâ€“Transformâ€“Load)** pipeline using **Python** and **SQL**, performs **data cleaning and summarization**, and finally delivers insights through **EDA and Power BI dashboards**.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Automated Data Ingestion:**  
  - `ingestion.py` connects to the SQL database and fetches raw vendor and sales data.
  - Handles large datasets and ensures data consistency during import.

- **Data Transformation & Integration:**  
  - Cleans and merges multiple tables into a single, standardized dataset.
  - Implements the `get_vendor_summary()` function to create a consolidated vendor performance table.
  - Saves the cleaned and summarized data back into SQL for future use.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Conducted in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
  - Includes insights such as top-performing vendors, sales trends, and seasonal sales behavior.

- **Business Intelligence Dashboard:**  
  - Power BI dashboard visualizes vendor sales KPIs:
    - Total Sales by Vendor  
    - Quantity Sold  
    - Average Order Value  
    - Revenue Trends  
  - Enables stakeholders to make data-driven business decisions quickly.
